    <h1>Kira the Maleficent</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kira and I'm a maleficent cat. I live in a nice house, with two humans and another cat named Hoshi. They all exist just to please me!</p>

    <figcaption>Hello, this is me. Don't I look mean?</figcaption>
    <p>Here are some things I like to do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sleep.</li>
      <li>Do mean things to Hoshi!</li>
      <li>Be petted by my favourite human.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And some things I hate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To see Hoshi be petted. Whenever this happens he feels my revenge afterwards.</li>
      <li>To be kissed in the belly by the second human.</li>
      <li>Children!</li>
    </ul>
